# Welcome {.unnumbered}

If my R analysis yields the number 4, and I run the same analysis a week from now with the same outcome (4), is my analysis considered **reproducible**?

The answer...*maybe?*

While the concept of reproducibility may differ from one data science team to the next, most reproducible analyses share certain criteria:

-   **Stable** - will my analysis yield the *same outcome* today, tomorrow, a year from now, 10 years from now, etc.?

-   **Shareable** - can I *share* my analysis with a colleague, a friend, a random person on the other side of the world?

-   **Intuitive** - can someone step into my analysis and know *how* to reproduce my work?

# Goal of this book

To provide you with the skills and knowledge to create **reproducible** R analyses that are stable, shareable, and intuitive.
:::

We will discuss reproducibility from two angles:

1.  Understanding your R environment
2.  Reproducible techniques

## Book Structure

It's also the goal of this book to provide you with the **minimal skill-set** required to create reproducible analyses in R and will purposefully not be a deep dive into any one topic. Each chapter/topic in this book will provide you with a *foundational understanding* so that you can easily build you knowledge base and confidently explore any one topic in more detail. I will also include references when applicable for each topic to help guide deeper explorations.

Each chapter/topic will include the following:

-   A (often silly) story to help conceptualize the importance of each topic

-   An overview of the topic geared towards R users that are new to reproducible analyses.

-   Minimal code and/or working example to get you started.
