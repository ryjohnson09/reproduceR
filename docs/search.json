Each chapter/topic in this book will provide you with a foundational understanding so that you can easily build you knowledge base and confidently explore any one topic in more detail. I will also include references when applicable for each topic to help guide deeper explorations.\nEach chapter/topic will include the following:\n\nA (often silly) story to help conceptualize the importance of each topic\nAn overview of the topic geared towards R users that are new to reproducible analyses.\nMinimal code and/or working example to get you started."
