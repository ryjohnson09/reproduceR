Each chapter/topic in this book will provide you with a foundational understanding so that you can easily build you knowledge base and confidently explore any one topic in more detail. I will also include references when applicable for each topic to help guide deeper explorations.\nEach chapter/topic will include the following:\n\nA (often silly) story to help conceptualize the importance of each topic.\nAn overview of the topic geared towards R users that are new to reproducible analyses.\nMinimal code and/or working example to get you started."

You may have a single one of each in your home directory (Sys.getenv(\"R_HOME\")), and additional ones within various project directories. Upon startup, R will check the following paths for these files in order:\n\nIf set, the path encoded by the R_ENVIRON_USER or R_PROFILE_USER variables\n\nSys.getenv(\"R_ENVIRON_USER\")\nSys.getenv(\"R_PROFILE_USER\")\n\nYour current working directory: getwd()\nYour home directory: Sys.getenv(\"R_HOME\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nR first searches and executes .Renviron (if present) before sourcing .Rprofile."

These are known as site wide files and are conveniently named .Renviron.site and .Rprofile.site.\nYou may also find a separate Renviron file within the R_HOME/etc/ directory. This file contains environment variables set by R in the configure process and should never be manually modified."
