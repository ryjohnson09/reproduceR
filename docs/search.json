Each chapter/topic in this book will provide you with a foundational understanding so that you can easily build you knowledge base and confidently explore any one topic in more detail. I will also include references when applicable for each topic to help guide deeper explorations.\nEach chapter/topic will include the following:\n\nA (often silly) story to help conceptualize the importance of each topic.\nAn overview of the topic geared towards R users that are new to reproducible analyses.\nMinimal code and/or working example to get you started."

    "text": "My first car in high school was a 2001 Toyota Corolla. I loved this car mostly for its simplicity; I would turn on the car, and start driving. Fast forward 20+ years, when I turn on my current car now, there are a series of actions completed before I start driving including:\n\nThe steering wheel adjusts to my pre-configured height.\nMy cell phone connects to to the car’s bluetooth.\nRadio turns on and switches to my favorite station.\n\nNow imagine if someone taller than me, with a different cell phone, and different taste in music turns on my car. They are going to have a bad experience because my car is customized to me.\nR is like my car. When “turning on” a new R session, there are a series of user-specific setup tasks that are completed before you can “start driving”. This is a very powerful feature of R which allows you to customize R to your specific needs. However, customizing the R startup process is user-specific and adds an extra layer of complexity to your R environment which may result in non-portable and non-reproducible code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is recommend that users do not modify the R startup process.\n\n\nThere are a handful of files that can be used to modify the R startup process. It is still important to know what these files are and how they are executed upon R startup to modify your R environment.\n\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/startup/vignettes/startup-intro.html\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Scripting-with-R (Appendix B Invoking R)\nhttps://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/04/19/r-for-enterprise-understanding-r-s-startup/"
